# NetworkManager-nonprism
Use the MAC-address-randomisation feature of NetworkManager

This script doesn't install NetworkManager itself, please install it by yourself.
Instead, it just installs a configuration file which enables the feature mentioned above.

这个只是个脚本安装了一个配置文件（里面启动了MAC地址随机化的功能）；并不自动安装NetworkManager，请自行安装。
